## Development Inspiration

Built from analyzing the existing Elfsight RSS feed widget structure, extracting key design patterns:
- Masonry container with positioned cards
- Episode metadata display (title, description, date, podcast branding)
- Share button functionality and RSS source attribution
- Responsive card scaling and smooth transitions

Integrated with McCal Media's performance-first architecture and liquid glass design system for consistent branding and optimal user experience.
