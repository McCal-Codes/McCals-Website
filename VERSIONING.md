# Versioning Guidelines

This repository follows a conservative semantic versioning approach to keep version numbers meaningful and proportional to the actual scope of changes.

## Version Scale

- **0.0.1** - Tiny fixes (typos, minor text changes, small corrections)
- **0.1** - Small fixes/improvements (UI tweaks, link consolidation, minor feature updates)
- **0.5** - Medium updates (adding new sections, features, significant content changes)
- **1.0** - Major updates (WordPress integration, complete redesigns, new functionality, architectural changes)

## Examples

- **v1.3.1**: Footer navigation consolidation (replaced separate legal links with single "Policies & Legal" link)
- **v1.3**: Podcast widget with audio previews
- **Future v1.5**: WordPress integration would warrant this level
- **Future v2.0**: Complete site redesign or major platform migration

## Philosophy

Version numbers should reflect the true impact of changes on users and developers. Small fixes get small version bumps - save the big numbers for truly significant updates.
